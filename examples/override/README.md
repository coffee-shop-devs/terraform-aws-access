# Override Example

This example overrides all objects generating nothing, but resulting in similar output as the basic example usage.
The concept for this module is to validate that it is possible to include this module in several implementations and validate or retrieve the objects while not generating them.
This module will fail if it is not able to produce expected output.

This example has been validated using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/), a Go sdk and test suite for Terraform.
